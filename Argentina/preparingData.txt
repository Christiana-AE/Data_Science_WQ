In this project, you're working for a client who wants to create a model that can predict the price of apartments in the 
city of Buenos Aires â€” with a focus on apartments that cost less than $400,000 USD.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
### Task
Write a function to clean your data so that it only contains properties in Capital Federal which are apartments and for which
the cost in dollars is less than $400,000


### Solution

def wrangle(filepath):
    df = pd.read_csv(filepath)
    
    # Subset to properties in "Capital Federal"
    mask_ba = df["place_with_parent_names"].str.contains("Capital Federal")
    
    #Subset to Properties that are apartments
    mask_apt = df["property_type"] == "apartment"
    
    # Subset to Properties where price in Dollars is less than 400,000
    mask_price = df["price_aprox_usd"] < 400_000
    
    df = df[mask_ba & mask_apt & mask_price]

    return df

df = wrangle("data/buenos-aires-real-estate-1.csv")
df.head()

# Check your work
assert (
    len(df) <= 1781
), f"`df` should have no more than 1781 observations, not {len(df)}."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Task:
Create a histogram of "surface_covered_in_m2". Make sure that the x-axis has the label "Area [sq meters]" and the plot 
has the title "Distribution of Apartment Sizes".

Solution
plt.hist(df["surface_covered_in_m2"])
plt.xlabel("Area [sq meters]")
plt.title("Distribution of Apartment sizes")
